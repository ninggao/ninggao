<h2><span>Entity Linking for Communication Contents</span></h2>
<h3><span>Jun.2013 ~ Present @ Human Language Technology Center of Excellence (HLTCOE)</span></h3>
<p>Entity linking has been well explored on third person communications, such as news
and Wikipedia, where the author, reader and social context do not matter much. I am
interested in entity linking on first person communications, such as the emails. My current
work includes inferring the latent social and topical context to resolve person name
entity linking, detecting and clustering the NIL resolutions, and maintaining multiple
knowledge bases to resolve first and third person entity linking in one concrete system.</p>

<h2><span>Active Named Entity Recognition for Domain-Specific Collections</span></h2>
<h3><span>Jun 2015 ~ Aug 2015 @ Microsoft Cloud and Information Service Lab, Redmond</span></h3>
<h3><span>Advisor: Nikos Karampatziakis</span></h3>
<p>The task of Named Entity Recognition (NER) has been well studied for the types of Person, Organization and Location. However, there are few work focusing on NER for domain-specific collections, which is a more challenging task. First, the users may have specific needs on extracting certain types of entities other than the pre-defined types in most existing NER systems. Second, the users may have different definitions on named mentions that should be recognized. We propose a named entity recognition system for domain-specific collections by using active learning, in which the users have the freedom to define any types of named mentions that should be recognized.  </p>

<h2><span>Entity Linking for Multiple Knowledge Bases</span></h2>
<h3><span>Jun 2014 ~ Aug 2014 @ Microsoft Research, Redmond</span></h3>
<h3><span>Advisor: Silviu Cucerzan</span></h3>
<p>We address the task of entity linking to multiple knowledge bases. In particular, we investigate the use of Wikipedia as a large encyclopedic knowledge base in conjunctions with over one thousand domain-specific knowledge bases derived from wiki collection available on Wikia.com. Our system employs a two-step approach: for each document, a supervised model with a large set of features detects first whether there is Wikia collection whose domain matches the document. When there is, the system then extracts the entity mentions in the document and resolves them to the merged knowledge base of Wikipedia and the matched Wikia. </p>

    <p>Applying KELVIN, a Cold Start Knowledge Base Population system, to mixed genres,
initially building a knowledge base from State Department cables, Time Magazine
articles and Wikipedia pages that address similar events; then using those sources to explore
dynamic updating of a partial knowledge base built from one source using another
source.</p>

    <h2><span>Judgement and Evaluation</span></h2>
<h3><span>Sep. 2012 ~ Jan. 2013 @ E-Discovery Lab, University of Maryland, College Park, </span></h3>
    <p>Proposed a novel system comparison method based on the expectation-maximization
algorithm. I have shown that a heuristic that selects for judgment the documents that
the system believes are most likely to be relevant yields strong improvements over other
reasonable baselines (such as random selection).</p>
